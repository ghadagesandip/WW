In an Web Werks cloud, any attack on the host OS has no direct effect on client virtual machines.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id="four">\r\n<h2><a href="javascript:void(0)">Firewall Security</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Web Werks cloud platform has four layers of firewall protection. This includes firewalls on the network, firewalls on hypervisors and firewalls on individual virtual machines. This may, of course, be extended with additional hardware/software firewall at the network infrastructure, hypervisor and virtual machine layer.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Network / infrastructure firewalls:</strong> hardware firewalls built into the cloud host&rsquo;s network infrastructure / data center infrastructure.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Hypervisor firewalls: </strong> Web Werks Cloud Hosting Infrastructure makes full use of all security features built into supported Hypervisor platforms to maintain complete isolation of virtual machines and their Data.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>WCCIM firewalls: </strong> It also features proprietary firewall technology built into hypervisors as part of the WCCIM module. This provides additional anti-spoofing and anti-sniffing protection to ensure VMs cannot interact with other VMs&rsquo; data, except where explicitly allowed. The firewall examine packets entering and leaving virtual machines, blocks any that do not meet rules set by the Web Werks Controller server.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Virtual machine firewalls: </strong> the final layer is an end-user firewall that is configurable on each individual virtual machine. Each VM can be configured to accept or drop traffic from specified IPs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id="five">\r\n<h2><a href="javascript:void(0)">Security VM templates</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Web Werks virtual machine templates can easily be configured with dedicated security technologies, such as Gazzang encryption. By incorporating additional security technologies into virtual machines, cloud hosts (and their customers) can easily configure virtual machines to support additional security and compliance requirements, such as PCI.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id="five">\r\n<h2><a href="javascript:void(0)">Permissions Engine</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Detailed permissions engine offers a further level of security. Every function in our cloud can be enabled or disabled for any user on-demand. This can be used to prevent unauthorized users from modifying hypervisor, network, data store and other sensitive elements of the cloud, as well as more fundamental tasks such as preventing one user from seeing another user&rsquo;s virtual machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benefits:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>High Performance </strong> Web Werks cloud is optimized across the stack for high performance &mdash; from premium hardware to custom performance enhancing technologies and meeting your requirements.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Global Footprint </strong> Choose where your data and applications reside.
